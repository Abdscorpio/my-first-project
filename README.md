# E-Commerce project I did in java
Used in Eclipse IDE (Recommended) 
Make sure you are in the JtProject directory
Configure the database connection in application.properties file 
Run the project (by running the `main` method in `JtSpringProjectApplication.java`)
Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser!
If you ran the [`basedata.sql`](https://github.com/jaygajera17/E-commerce-project-springBoot/blob/master2/JtProject/basedata.sql)script on the database, you can log in with the following credentials as admin; otherwise you'll have to manually create an admin user in the database:
 * Username: `admin`
     * Password: `123`
   * Log in as a normal user:
     * Username: `lisa`
     * Password: `765`
